Abstract:
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was enacted by Congress in 1975 and was implemented by 
the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation C. This regulation provides the public loan data that can be used 
to assist the public officials in distributing public-sector investments so as to attract private investment to 
areas where it is needed and in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns. Nowadays, there are 
numerous risks related to providing loans both for the financial institutions and the borrowers getting the 
loans. Financial Institutions need to analyze their customers for loan eligibility so that they can also target 
those customers. These Institutions may want to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on 
customer details, since the volume of data is rapidly growing day-by-day. This data can be used to analyze 
the customer’s behavior and the risk around loan can be reduced. Also these Institutions receive numerous 
loan requests each day and it may take a while to process a particular application and make a decision 
regarding its eligibility for loan.



Solution Offered:
Automating the loan approval process can save a huge amount of time and man-power for a Financial 
Institution. Machine Learning can be used to automate the loan eligibility process and provide near-accurate 
predictions on whether a loan application should be approved or not based on the customer's financial 
information and demographics. We are trying to build a model which takes around 90 identifiers like the sex, 
race, and income of those applying for obtaining mortgages and predict whether the loan is approved or 
not. This would automate the whole process of predicting the approval of loan for an individual based on 
customer’s identifications.
